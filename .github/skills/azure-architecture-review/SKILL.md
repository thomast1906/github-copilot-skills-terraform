# Azure Architecture Review Skill

This skill **reviews Terraform code** for Azure resources against Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and Well-Architected Framework (WAF). It analyzes `.tf` files to ensure your infrastructure-as-code follows Microsoft's frameworks.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Reviewing Terraform code** - Check `.tf` files against CAF/WAF before deployment
- **Pull request reviews** - Validate infrastructure-as-code changes
- **Architecture validation** - Ensure Terraform designs follow Microsoft frameworks
- **Before terraform apply** - Catch compliance issues early in development
- **Code refactoring** - Align existing Terraform with CAF/WAF best practices
- **Compliance audits** - Review infrastructure-as-code for governance

## Applicable to ALL Azure Resources

This skill works for:
- **Networking**: Virtual Networks, Firewalls, VPN Gateways, Load Balancers
- **Compute**: Virtual Machines, App Service, AKS, Container Instances
- **Storage**: Storage Accounts, Managed Disks, File Shares
- **Databases**: SQL Database, Cosmos DB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Security**: Key Vault, Managed Identity, Private Endpoints
- **Monitoring**: Log Analytics, Application Insights, Alerts
- **And more**: Any Azure service with Terraform support

## Prerequisites

**Required MCP Tools**:
- `mcp_azure_mcp_documentation` - Search Microsoft Learn documentation
- `mcp_azure_mcp_azureterraformbestpractices` - Get Terraform-specific Azure guidance

**Context Needed**:
- Understanding of the infrastructure being reviewed
- Business requirements (SLA, security, compliance)
- Current state (greenfield vs brownfield)

## Review Methodology

### Step 1: Get Terraform Best Practices (MANDATORY)

**Always call this FIRST before generating or reviewing Terraform code:**

```bash
# MCP Command
mcp_azure_mcp_azureterraformbestpractices
  command: get
  intent: "Get Azure Terraform best practices before code review"
```

**Returns**: Terraform validation workflow (validate → plan → apply), Azure-specific patterns, security defaults, naming conventions

### Step 2: Search Cloud Adoption Framework Documentation

**Query Pattern**: `"Cloud Adoption Framework {resource-type} {design-area}"`

**Examples**:
```bash
# Networking
query: "Cloud Adoption Framework hub spoke network topology"

# Storage
query: "Cloud Adoption Framework storage account security encryption"

# Compute
query: "Cloud Adoption Framework App Service landing zone networking"

# Databases
query: "Cloud Adoption Framework Azure SQL Database security"

# Security
query: "Cloud Adoption Framework Key Vault secrets management"
```

**Key CAF Design Areas** (apply to ALL resources):
1. **Resource Organization** - Naming, resource groups, subscriptions
2. **Security** - Authentication, encryption, network isolation, RBAC
3. **Network Topology** - VNet integration, private endpoints, connectivity
4. **Identity & Access** - Managed identities, RBAC, Azure AD
5. **Governance** - Tags, Azure Policy, diagnostics, cost tracking

### Step 3: Search Well-Architected Framework Documentation

**Query Pattern**: `"Well-Architected Framework {pillar} {service-name} {concern}"`

**Generic Pillar Queries**:
```bash
# Reliability
query: "Well-Architected Framework reliability availability zones disaster recovery"

# Security  
query: "Well-Architected Framework security encryption network access control"

# Cost Optimization
query: "Well-Architected Framework cost optimization pricing SKU right-sizing"

# Operational Excellence
query: "Well-Architected Framework operational excellence monitoring diagnostics"

# Performance Efficiency
query: "Well-Architected Framework performance efficiency scalability throughput"
```

**Service-Specific Pattern**: `"{Service} Well-Architected {pillar}"`
```bash
# Examples
query: "Storage Account Well-Architected security encryption"
query: "App Service Well-Architected reliability availability zones"
query: "Azure SQL Database Well-Architected reliability high availability"
query: "Key Vault Well-Architected security access policies"
```

### Step 4: Service-Specific Guidance

Search for service-specific WAF guidance:

```bash
# Pattern: "{Azure Service} Well-Architected best practices"
query: "Azure Firewall Well-Architected best practices"
query: "VPN Gateway Well-Architected reliability"
query: "Virtual Machines Well-Architected best practices"
query: "Azure Kubernetes Service Well-Architected security"
```

## Overall Score: 82/100

### High Priority

**Zone Redundancy Not Enabled** (Reliability)
```hcl
# Current (⚠️)
sku_name = "P1v2"  # Doesn't support zones

# Production (✅)
sku_name               = "P1v3"  # PremiumV3
zone_balancing_enabled = true    # Zone redundancy

}
```
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### 🔍 Search Query Optimization

**Good queries** (specific, actionable):
- "Cloud Adoption Framework {service} security best practices"
- "Well-Architected Framework {service} reliability zones"
- "{service} encryption private endpoint security baseline"

**Poor queries** (too broad):
- "Azure best practices" ❌
- "Cloud Adoption Framework" ❌
- "security" ❌

### 🎯 Resource-Agnostic Approach

The methodology is the same for ALL resources:
1. Call Terraform best practices (always first)
2. Search CAF for resource-specific guidance
3. Search WAF for each pillar
4. Generate report with scores and recommendations

**The queries change, the methodology doesn't!**

### ⚡ Common Gaps to Check

1. **Missing diagnostic settings** - Most common WAF gap
2. **No NSG flow logs** - Security and operational visibility
3. **Hardcoded values** - Should use variables
4. **No cost estimates** - Users need to understand spend
5. **Missing examples** - Modules need working examples

### 🎯 Validation Priority

1. **Security** - Always highest priority (breaches are expensive)
2. **Reliability** - Downtime impacts business
3. **Operational Excellence** - Reduces long-term costs
4. **Cost Optimization** - Balance with other pillars
5. **Performance Efficiency** - Optimize after stability

## Scoring Framework

**Overall Score Calculation**:
```
Total Score = (CAF Score × 0.4) + (WAF Score × 0.6)
CAF Score = (Topology + Naming + Tagging + Organization) / 4
WAF Score = (Reliability + Security + Cost + OpEx + Performance) / 5
```

**Grade Interpretation**:
- **90-100%**: ✅ Excellent - Production ready
- **80-89%**: ✅ Good - Minor enhancements needed
- **70-79%**: ⚠️ Acceptable - Several improvements required
- **60-69%**: ⚠️ Needs Work - Significant gaps
- **Below 60%**: ❌ Not Recommended - Major revisions needed
